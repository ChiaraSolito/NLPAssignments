# NLPAssignments
Assignments for NLP course, followed during the master degree in Artificial Intelligence @ UniVR.
## Assignment n.1
The assignment consists in the development, in NLTK, OpenNLP, SketchEngine or GATE/Annie a Na√Øve Bayes Classifier able to detect a single class in one of the corpora available as attachments to the chosen package, by distinguishing ENGLISH against NON-ENGLISH. In particular the classifier has to be:

1. Trained on a split subset of the chosen corpus, by either using an existing partition between sample documents for training and for test or by using a random splitter among the available ones;

2. Devised as a pipeline of any chosen format, including the simplest version based on word2vec on a list of words obtained by one of the available lexical resources.

The test of the classifier shall give out the measures of accuracy, precision, recall on the obtained confusion matrix and WILL NOT BE EVALUATED ON THE LEVEL OF THE PERFORMANCES. In other terms, when the confusion is produced, then the value of the assignment will be good, independently of the percentage of false positive and negative results.

Deliver a short set of comments on the experience (do not deliver the entire code, but link it on a public repository like GitHub or the GATE Repo).\
Discuss: size of the corpus, size of the split training and test sets, performance indicators employed and their nature, employability of the classifier as a Probabilistic Language Model.
